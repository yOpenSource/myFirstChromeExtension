# myFirstChromeExtension

Here, I am trying to add a chrome extension... lets see how far I get it.. ;)



## **Steps to run the code :**

- open chrome://extensions

- on the developer mode

- save files from extensions folder on your local drive

- select load unpacked and then select your folder

- and load or reload any site and check the console 




### Note : 


> - If your chrome extensions work fine and you would change some of the code locally then you will have to go to the chrome://extensions 
page and reload your extension.

> - Whenever you add external js to your extension at that time you will have to add its name in the manifest.json
