# myFirstChromeExtension
Here, I am trying to add a chrome extension... lets see how far I get it.. ;)

## **Steps to run the code :**
- open chrom://extensions
- on the developer mode
- select load unpacked
- and load or reload any site and check the console 


Note : 

> If your chrome extensions work fine and you would change some of the code locally then you will have to go to the chrome://extensions page and reload your extension.
> Whenever you add external js to your extension at that time you will have to add its name in the manifest.json
