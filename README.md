# myFirstChromeExtension

Here, I am trying to add a chrome extension... lets see how far I get it.. ;)



## **Steps to run the code :**

- open chrome://extensions

- on the developer mode

- save files from [extensions folder](https://github.com/yOpenSource/myFirstChromeExtension/tree/master/extension) on your local drive

- select ```load unpacked``` from [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) and then select the downloaded **extensions** folder

- and visit any site  and the check console

- read the script in the **extensions** folder to understand the working of the added scripts

- ```manifest.json``` contains the configuration information





### Note : 


> - If your chrome extensions work fine and you would change some of the code locally then you will have to go to the chrome://extensions 
page and reload your extension.

> - Whenever you add external js to your extension at that time you will have to add its name in the manifest.json

> - Do not use inconginto as extensios are disabled in inconginto mode

> - Your extension will appear near the address bar

> - You can find very cool extensions over https://chrome.google.com/webstore/category/extensions

> - Also visit  https://developer.chrome.com/apps/match_patterns for extra information
